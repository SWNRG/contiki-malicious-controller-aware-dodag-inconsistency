## Maximum pause time [s]
#10
## Maximum x-coordinate [m]
#175
## Maximum y-coordinate [m]
#150
## Minimum speed [m/s]
#1
## Maximum speed [m/s]
#4
## How long time to disregard from the start of the simulation [s] (note 1)
#10

# Time for simulation [s] 
#5 HOURS
18000 
# Time resolution [s]

# How long time to disregard from the start of the simulation [s]
# (in RWMM, the beginning of the simulation can be disproportionate, hence
# it is common to disregard the beginning of it.)
